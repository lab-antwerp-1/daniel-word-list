# Daniel's word-list

This my own list-maker application. Create and remove your own list items in a very simple interface so you can focus in the words and not how good the developer is.

## Motivation

Practicing how to structure projects and websites using github and splitting the project into manageable 'modules'.

## Technologies

This project only uses HTML, CSS and JS.

## Functionality

From the grocery shopping to the pending tasks of the day, feel free to use this list-maker your own way.
